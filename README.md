## ToDo

Let's practice if statements! 

Create a new ruby file in your development directory. In Terminal, type `touch if_statement.rb`. You'll be coding your solution in that file.

Create a method called `need_gas?` that accepts an argument. The argument you pass should be the amount of miles you've driven the car. You'll want the body of the method to contain an if statement that tells you whether or not you need gas depending on the amount of miles you've driven.


I want to be able to call the method by saying `need_gas?(100)`, meaning after I've driven 100 miles, do I need to stop and get gas? It's up to you to decide how many miles means someone needs to get gas, and what messages to use to alert them.
